# topScorer(data) [10 Points]
# Write the function topScorer(data) that takes a multi-line 
# string encoding scores as csv data for some kind of 
# competition with players receiving scores, so each 
# line has comma-separated values. The first value on 
# each line is the name of the player (which you can 
# assume has no integers in it), and each value after 
# that is an individual score (which you can assume is a 
# non-negative integer). You should add all the scores 
# for that player, and then return the player with the 
# highest total score. If there is a tie, return all the 
# tied players in a comma-separated string with the names 
# in the same order they appeared in the original data. 
# If nobody wins (there is no data), return None (not the 
# string "None"). So, for example:

def topScorer(data):
    # Your code goes here...
    if (data == ""):
        return None
    a=[]
    b=[]
    x=data.split('\n')
    for i in range(len(x)-1):
        a.append(x[i].split(","))
    for j in range(len(a)):
        b.append(a[j][0])
        del a[j][0]
    z=max(a[0])
    y=max(a[1])
    if z>y: 
        return b[0]
    elif y>z: 
        return b[1]
    else:
        separator = ','
        d=(str(separator.join(b)))
        return d
